# LiDAR-SLAM

Each of the files are a mini-projects about autonomous vehicles principles such as SLAM, Visual Odometry, and Object Detection. 

# LiDARDataOccupancyMap

This mini project creates occupancy maps from LiDAR scan data provided by the SLAM MATLAB toolbox. The project uses LiDAR scan data from an autonomous vehicle navigating a building, to create simultaneous maps(SLAM) as the data from the scans are processed. Output includes graphs of improvement in generated maps post-algorithms such as loop closures and pose graph optimization. The generated map is used to build a final occupancy map, which illustrates the predicted map of the building.
