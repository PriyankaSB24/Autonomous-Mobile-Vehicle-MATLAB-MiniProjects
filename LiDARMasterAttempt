% liderslam object automatically performs slam for a sensor reading, given the range and resolution of the map
slamAlg = lidarSLAM(mapResolution, maxLidarRange);

% loop closure happens to 'tighten' the model and prevent discrepencies between actual location and calculated location
% higher threshold = better closing of the loop
slamAlg.LoopClosureThreshold = 210;  
% when the closure process starts, within 8 m of start
slamAlg.LoopClosureSearchRadius = 8;

% adding 10 scans itertively to the slamAlg object, based on the distances between the nodes
for i=1:10
    % command automatically determines if scan is accepted

    % IsPerformed boolean says if pose graph optimization has been performed
    % if the point cloud had Pose graph optimization and no first loop closure
    % this graphs the optimization and pre-closure and post-closure on the same
    % graph to see how loop closure affects data
